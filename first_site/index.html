    <p>The <small>hand</small> has become <em>increasingly</em> less present in the web as we know it today. Websites are automated or built from templates, and the knowledge of how to make a website is relegated to a select few. It has only gotten easier to learn and make on the web, but the idea and perceived requirements for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject.
    This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will <strong>emphasize the hand-quality of websites</strong> by developing an understanding of the <b>best practices, language, history, and present context</b> of the web. <br>
  </p>
    <p class="blue-text">We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space. <a href="projects/pagetwo.html">lets go</a></p>
